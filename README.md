## 🌟 Our Vision
In an age of digital distraction, AERO's mission is to give you back your focus. By leveraging **Neural Inference**, we don't just track *where* you spend time, but *how* that time impacts your cognitive state. AERO is built to be the "Second Brain" for your productivity, auto-adjusting your environment to keep you in the Flow Zone.

## 🧩 Internal Service Deep-Dive

### **1. Chrome Extension (The Observer)**
The core tracking engine resides in the extension's background service worker and content scripts.
- **Manifest V3**: Uses modern Chrome APIs for background persistence.
- **Content Scripts**: Injected into every tab to capture `document.title` and monitor active focus.
- **Background Worker**: Handles the polling logic and batching of telemetry to minimize network overhead.
- **Storage API**: Locally caches blocklists for zero-latency blocking even when offline.

### **2. Auth Service (`:5001`)**
Manages the user lifecycle and security.
- **JWT Implementation**: Uses short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens.
- **Google OAuth**: Integrated Passport strategy for one-click onboarding.
- **Preference Sync**: Stores theme, notification, and Pomodoro settings centrally.

### **3. Tracking Service (`:5002`)**
The high-velocity data ingestion engine.
- **Aggregation Logic**: Transforms raw per-second telemetry into meaningful hourly/daily buckets.
- **Goal Engine**: Calculates progress against user-defined targets in real-time.
- **Heatmap Generation**: Generates GitHub-style activity maps for long-term trend analysis.

### **4. AI Service (`:8000`)**
FastAPI-based Python engine for cognitive analysis.
- **NLP Classifier**: Uses a lightweight Transformer model to categorize URLs and page titles.
- **Fatigue Heuristic**: Analyzes context-switching frequency to generate a "Cognitive Load" score (1-10).

## 💾 Database Schema (MongoDB Atlas)

### **User Document**
- `preferences`: { `theme`, `notifications`, `pomodoroWork`, `strictMode`, etc. }
- `googleId`: (Optional) for OAuth users.
- `lastSeen`: Updated on every dashboard visit.

### **Tracking Document**

## 🔄 The AERO Workflow (The 4-Step Cycle)

1.  **Capture**: The Extension monitors your active tab, capturing Title, URL, and Duration every second.
2.  **Classify**: Data is hashed and sent to the AI Engine. NLP models determine if the site is "Deep Work" or "Distraction".
3.  **Shield**: If distractions exceed your threshold, the **Focus Shield** activates, enforcing your blocklist across all devices.
4.  **Reflect**: Use the Dashboard to review your **Momentum Score** and adjust your goals for the next sprint.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] **Mobile Companion**: iOS/Android app for cross-platform focus.
- [ ] **Team Analytics**: Productivity benchmarking for engineering teams.
- [ ] **Smart Scheduling**: Suggesting deep-work blocks based on your peak AI hours.
- [ ] **Integrations**: Auto-sync with Jira, GitHub, and Slack to correlate work output.
